# Election_Analysis

# Background info for later

You are tasked with reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

There are three primary voting methods that you and Tom will take into account, mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic, or DRE, counting machines. Mail-in ballots are typically hand counted at the central office. Punch cards are collected and then fed into a machine that tabulates vote totals and sends the results to the central office. Finally, memory cards from DRE counting machines are sent to the central office and read by a computer.

Project goal:
In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 

Total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
Total number of votes each candidate received
Percentage of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
